PROJECT TITLE: Advent of Code 2021

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To improve my programming and problem-solving skills

VERSION or DATE: 02/12/21 to 12/01/22

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Follow the instructions as given on the Advent
of Code website: https://adventofcode.com/2021

AUTHORS: Code written by Matthew McCabe, as a response to the puzzles given
by Eric Wastl on the Advent of Code website

USER INSTRUCTIONS: From this you can make an account to get a unique set of
puzzle inputs, which need to be saved as .txt files
Once this has been done, the programs will be able to give an output for
your personal inputs.

SKILLS: Each of the puzzles demonstrates the following skills:
 - All Days: Reading Files using Scanners, Strings, booleans and ints,
	methods, if statements, for and while loops, and print statements.
 - Day 1 (SonarSweep): Arrays
 - Day 2 (Dive): Switch statements
 - Day 3 (BinaryDiagnostic): ArrayLists
 - Day 4 (Bingo): Arrays, Nested ArrayLists, Objects
 - Day 5 (Vents): 2D Arrays
 - Day 6 (Lanternfish): Longs and Simulation
 - Day 7 (CrabSubs): Optimisation problem for minimum cost
 - Day 8 (SevenSegmentSearch): Sets and Logic puzzles
 - Day 9 (SmokeBasin): Iterative Algorithms, Sets and Points
 - Day 10 (SyntaxScoring): Switch statements, Maps, Stacks and Longs
 - Day 11 (Octopus): Simulation, Stacks, Sets and Points
 - Day 12 (Passage): Recursion, Maps and Sets
 - Day 13 (Origami): Sets and Points
 - Day 14 (Polymerization): Maps, Sets and Points, Longs and Simulation
 - Day 15 (Chiton): 2D Arrays, Points, Sets, Optimisation problem for minimum cost
 - Day 16 (Decoder): Recursion, Switch statements, Longs and Queues
